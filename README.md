
## Mnemonic Phrase Creator

This Python script creates a mnemonic expression and allows the user to continuously generate expressions and save them in a file called `seed.txt`.
### Requirements

- Python

### Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python generator.py
```

### Options

- After every 100 generated mnemonic phrases, the script prompts the user with a message asking if they want to continue generating more phrases. Respond with 'y' to continue or any other key to terminate the loop. Optionally, you can change the value of 100.

### Note

The generated mnemonic phrases are appended to the `seed.txt` file in the project directory.
